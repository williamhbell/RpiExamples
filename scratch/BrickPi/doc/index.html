<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
The BrickPi provides an interface between LEGO® MINDSTORMS® motors and sensors and the Raspberry Pi.  The 
board has five sensor ports and four motor ports.  The Raspberry Pi communicates with the BrickPi over the 
serial port (UART), which is available via pins 8 and 10 of the 26 pin header on the Raspberry Pi: <a 
href="http://elinux.org/RPi_Low-level_peripherals">http://elinux.org/RPi_Low-level_peripherals</a>
</p>
<p>
The BrickPi is able to read both the sensors and the motor encoder values, providing a simple interface to a 
range of MINDSTORMS® based projects.  More details of the BrickPi are given in Issues 17 and 18 of The 
MagPi.
</p>
<p>
A local school decided to buy several BrickPi boards for their engineering course.  After a few tests, it 
was clear that a new Scratch driver was needed to allow the BrickPi to be used within the course material.  
To allow other Raspberry Pi GPIO connections to be used, and provide easy configuration of the BrickPi, 
RpiScratchIO was chosen as the basis of the Scratch interface.  More information on RpiScratchIO can be 
found in Issues 20 and 22 of The MagPi and at: <a 
href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/RpiScratchIO/">https://pypi.python.org/pypi/RpiScratchIO/</a>
</p>

<h3>Installation & configuration</h3>
<p>
These installation instructions start from the basic Raspbian image that can be downloaded from the 
Raspberry Pi web site:
<a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/">http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/</a>
</p>
<p>
The BrickPi Python and Scratch interfaces are available as a Python module. To install both interfaces, 
together with their dependencies, open a terminal window and type:
</p>
<p>
sudo apt-get install -y python-serial python-setuptools python-dev<br>
easy_install pip<br>
pip install BrickPi
</p>
<p>
To use the serial port to communicate with the BrickPi, it has to be available as an input/output (I/O) 
connection.  To allow a connection using the serial bus, the Raspbian configuration needs to be changed 
slightly.  Type:
</p>
<p>
sudo -s
</p>
<p>
Then use the  nano editor to edit /boot/config.txt:
</p>
<p>
nano /boot/config.txt
</p>
<p>
Go the end of the file and add:
</p>
<p>
init_uart_clock=32000000
</p>
<p>
Then save this file and open /etc/inittab.  Find, 
</p>
<p>
T0:23
</p>
<p>
and put a # character in front, to comment it out.  Then save it.  Next, open /boot/cmdline.txt and remove,
</p>
<p>
console=ttyAMA0,115200 kgdboc=ttyAMA0,115200
</p>
<p>
and save the file.  Now reboot the Raspberry Pi:
</p>
<p>
reboot
</p>

<h3>Building the tank</h3>
<p>
Follow the instructions given at, <a href="http://www.dexterindustries.com/BrickPi/projects/tank/">http://www.dexterindustries.com/BrickPi/projects/tank/</a> 
to build a tracked vehicle.  Then put the BrickPi on top and connect the right motor to BrickPi port MA and 
the left motor to BrickPi port MB.  Finally, add a forward-facing ultrasonic sensor and connect it to BrickPi 
sensor port S1.  The BrickPi port labelling is given in The MagPi Issue 18 article on the BrickPi.
</p>

<h3>Human controlled tank</h3>
<p>
The BrickPi has to be appropriately configured for each different LEGO® sensor.  Create a new file called 
tank.cfg that contains the following definitions: Now open Scratch and enable remote sensor connections, by 
selecting the "Sensing" palette and right clicking on "sensor value" at the bottom of the tool palette.  (For 
the current Raspbian version of Scratch, the remote sensor connections need to be disabled and then 
re-enabled.) Now start RpiScratchIO by typing:
</p>
<p>
RpiScratchIO tank.cfg
</p>
<p>
This creates new Scratch sensors with names within the ranges LEGO:0-LEGO:3, LEGO:10-LEGO:13 and 
LEGO:20-LEGO:23, where LEGO:0-LEGO:3 are the sensor ports S1-S4, LEGO:10-LEGO:13 correspond to the values 
written to the four motor ports MA-MB and LEGO:20-LEGO:23 are the motor encoders for MA-MB.  The sensor 
(S1-S4) and the motor encoder (MA-MB) values can be updated in Scratch by broadcasting read commands. For 
example,
</p>
<p>
LEGO:read:0
</p>
<p>
transfers the current S1 value into the Scratch sensor LEGO:0.  The motor speed can be changed by 
broadcasting a write command,
</p>
<p>
LEGO:write:10,255
</p>
<p>
where this sets the motor connected to MA to run forwards at full speed.  To stop the motor attached to MA, 
use Scratch to broadcast:
</p>
<p>
LEGO:write:10,0
</p>
<p>
If a sensor channel is used that has not been configured in the configuration file, then a warning is 
reported.  To update the sensors that are active in Scratch, exit RpiScratchIO by typing CTRL-C, edit the 
RpiScratchIO configuration file and then restart RpiScratchIO as before.
</p>

<p>
The BrickPiScratch interface can be easily used to control the position of the tank, using the keyboard.  In 
this example, a simple top view of a tank was used as the main sprite.  Then two sprites were made, one for 
each track of the vehicle.  The main sprite was then linked to the ultrasonic sensor and each track was 
linked to a motor.  The main sprite program, sends a read command to read the ultrasonic sensors, waits for 
half a second and then prints the value of the sensor.  The value of the sensor is also used to change the 
costume of the main sprite, to indicate if there is an object close by.
</p>

<p>
The program for the left motor,
</p>

<p>
sets the motor to run forward when the A key is held down.  When the key is released, the motor stops.  To 
make the motor go backwards, the Z key should be held down.  When the motor is running forwards or backwards, 
the track sprite colour changes to show that the motor is running.  The right track program is the same, but 
with the D and X keys and the motor channel 10.
</p>

<h3>Data acquisition & limits</h3>
<p>
To understand the limits of the Scratch driver, it is helpful to know what is happening within the driver and 
the BrickPi itself.  The BrickPi Scratch diver is written in Python and communicates between Scratch and the 
BrickPi.  If the Scratch driver sent the BrickPi a single motor controller command, the BrickPi would run the 
associated motor for about one second and then stop.  This design choice was make in the Brick itself to 
prevent run-away robots. To make Scratch programs more efficient and simpler, the Scratch driver starts a 
data acquisition loop with the BrickPi that runs every tenth of a second.  This loop sends the current motor 
values to the BrickPi and retrieves the current sensor values for the sensors that are enabled in the 
configuration file.  The current values for the sensors and motor encoders are stored in the BrickPi Scratch 
driver.  In this manner, the Scratch code can send a single value to the scratch driver and see quick updates 
of motor values.
</p>
<p>
Scratch running on a Raspberry Pi cannot receive sensor updates faster than approximately half a second.  
While requesting a value and then receiving it completely decouples Scratch from the fast data acquisition 
loop inside the Scratch driver, it also uses more processor time.  This is a good choice for monitoring long 
term changes, but does not work well for autonomous projects.
</p>
<p>
To reach the limit of Scratch I/O and performance, the BrickPi Scratch driver can be used to send regular 
sensor updates to Scratch.  This has two implications: (1) reduced number of broadcast messages and (2) the 
ability to trigger Scratch from the automatic readout.  Both of these changes ensure that the Scratch 
communication is as efficient as possible.
</p>
 
<h3>Autonomous tank</h3>
<p>
A human controlled vehicle is amusing, but a true robot should be able to function on its own.  To make 
decisions, the sensor updates within Scratch have to be as fast as possible.  This can be achieved by turning 
on the automatic update mechanism in the BrickPi Scratch driver.  Copy the tank.cfg file and rename it as 
autoTank.cfg.  Then change
</p>
<p>
BrickPiScratch()
</p>
<p>
to
</p>
<p>
BrickPiScratch(0,"s")
</p>
<p>
The number zero is the period of the automatic update in units of tenths of a second, where zero disables the 
automatic update of sensor values.  The value "s" configures all active sensors to be automatically updated.  
Other options are given at: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/BrickPi
</p>
<p>
Close the previous Scratch window and open a new one.  Set up the remote sensor connections as before.  Then 
type:
</p>
<p>
RpiScratchIO autoTank.cfg
</p>
<p>
This time the Scratch setup contains only one sprite.  The program for the sprite is given below and on the 
next page. When the green flag is clicked, the tank changes its costume to indicate that the automatic sensor 
update loop is running.  The local ("For this sprite only") variable US and global ("For all sprites") 
variables LEGO:10 and LEGO:11 are all set to zero.  Then the config:period,5 command is sent to start the 
automatic updates, which then run once every half a second.
</p>

<p>
Each time the sensors are automatically updated, a LEGO:trig message is sent to Scratch.  The LEGO:trig 
message is used to run the three sections that follow, where the first section stores the sensor value in the 
US variable and the other two sections control the two motors.  When the LEGO:10 or LEGO:11 values are 
updated, they are automatically sent to the BrickPi channels MA and MB respectively.
</p>

<p>
The last section is only run when the Q key is pressed on the keyboard, which stops the automatic updates.  
The program then waits, in case one motor command is still being processed.  Then the costume is set back to 
normal and both motors are stopped.
</p>

<p>
Try pointing the robot at a smooth wall and clicking on the green flag.  When the wall is far away, the 
motors will run at high speed.  Then the robot will slow down and finally stop.
